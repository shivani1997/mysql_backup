Back up From the Command Line (using mysqldump)

If you have shell or telnet access to your web server, you can backup your MySQL data by using the mysqldump command.
This command connects to the MySQL server and creates an SQL dump file.
The dump file contains the SQL statements necessary to re-create the database.
Here is the proper syntax:
$ mysqldump --opt -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname] > [backupfile.sql]

    [uname] Your database username
    [pass] The password for your database (note there is no space between -p and the password)
    [dbname] The name of your database
    [backupfile.sql] The filename for your database backup
    [--opt] The mysqldump option 

For example, to backup a database named 'Tutorials' with the username 'root' and with no password to a file tut_backup.sql,
you should accomplish this command:
$ mysqldump -u root -p Tutorials > tut_backup.sql
his command will backup the 'Tutorials' database into a file called tut_backup.sql which 
will contain all the SQL statements needed to re-create the database
With mysqldump command you can specify certain tables of your database you want to backup. 
For example, to back up only php_tutorials and asp_tutorials tables from the 'Tutorials' database accomplish the command below.
Each table name has to be separated by space.
